    Implement the functions as specified in the PASSWORD.PDF file.
	
	RESTRICTIONS:
	1. Make sure that you follow the function prototypes specified in population.h
	2. Do NOT call printf() or scanf() in any of the required function definition
	   EXCEPT in the main() function.
	3. Use only the library function that we discussed in class.  Non-compliance with
