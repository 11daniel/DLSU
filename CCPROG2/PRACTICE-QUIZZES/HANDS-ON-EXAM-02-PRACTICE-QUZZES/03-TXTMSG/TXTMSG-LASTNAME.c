    TO DO #1: 
    
    Implement the 5 functions that will compute and return a number that correspond as answer

    Except for Q1, the function prototype (i.e., return type, function name, and parameter list)
    for answering questions Q2 to Q5 are not given.  You have to figure it out on your own
    as part of your solution.

	2. Do NOT use any unnecessary parameter.  The function parameters should only be those
